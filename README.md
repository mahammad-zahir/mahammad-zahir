Hello, I'm Mahammad Zahir ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub profile! Iâ€™m a Data Analyst with a passion for turning data into actionable insights. I specialize in data visualization, statistical analysis, and data manipulation using a range of tools and technologies.

ðŸš€ About Me
ðŸ“š Education: BE in Computer Science and Engineering from Sahyadri College Of Engineering And Management
ðŸ›  Skills: Python, SQL, Excel, Tableau, Power BI
ðŸŒ± Currently Learning: Data Analyst Trainee at Trainity
ðŸŒŸ Interests: Data science, machine learning, statistical modeling, and data storytelling
ðŸ›  Projects
Here are some of the data analysis projects Iâ€™ve worked on:

Instagram User Analytics
This project involves analyzing Instagram user data using SQL and MySQL Workbench. The goal is to track and interpret user interactions and engagement to provide insights that support marketing campaigns, feature development, and overall user experience improvements. Your findings will assist the product team in making data-driven decisions to enhance the app's growth and functionality.

Operation Analytics and Investigating Metric Spikes
In this project, I undertook the role of a Lead Data Analyst to perform advanced operational analytics for a company like Microsoft. My focus was on analyzing various datasets to identify areas for improvement across operations, support, and marketing departments. A key part of the project involved investigating metric spikes, such as sudden drops in user engagement or sales, to understand and explain these anomalies. By applying advanced SQL techniques, I derived actionable insights to enhance company operations and address unexpected changes in key metrics.

Hiring Process Analytics
In this project, I analyzed hiring process data for a multinational company like Google to draw meaningful insights. The focus was on understanding trends in rejections, interviews, job types, and vacancies. I handled missing data, combined relevant columns, detected and addressed outliers, and summarized the dataset using statistical measures and visualizations. The goal was to provide actionable insights that could help improve the hiring process and support better decision-making.


Hereâ€™s a brief description for the "IMDB Movie Analysis" project for your README:

IMDB Movie Analysis
In this project, I analyzed an IMDB Movies dataset to determine factors influencing movie success, defined by high IMDB ratings. The analysis involved cleaning the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and performing feature engineering. I then explored the relationships between movie ratings and variables such as genre, director, budget, release year, and cast. The insights gained aim to help movie producers, directors, and investors make informed decisions for future projects.
